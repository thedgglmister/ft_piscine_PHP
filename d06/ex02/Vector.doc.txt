The Vector class defines a homogenous vector with x, y, z, and w coordinates.

An instance can be constructed by passing a "dest" instance of the Vertex Class, along with an optional "orig" Vertex.
If no "orig" is passed, it defaults to (0, 0, 0, 0, white).

new Vector( array("dest" => dest_vertex, "orig" => orig_vertex) );

The class provides the following methods:

float    magnitude(void): 
Returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector   normalize():
Returns a normalized version of the vector.

Vector   add( Vector $rhs ): 
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector   sub( Vector $rhs ):
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector   opposite():
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector   scalarProduct( $k ):
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float    dotProduct( Vector $rhs ):
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float    cos( Vector $rhs ): 
Returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.

Vector   crossProduct( Vector $rhs ):
Returns the cross product of both.
