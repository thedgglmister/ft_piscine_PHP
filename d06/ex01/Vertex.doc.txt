The Vertex class has x, y, z, and w attributes, as well as a color attribute.

An instance can be constructed from an array with mandatory x, y, and z values. 
w and color values are optional, and will default to 1.0 and white, respectively:

new Vertex( array( 'x' => 2, 'y' => 1.5, 'z' => 0.2, 'w' => 1.0, 'color' => $color) );

x, y, z, and w are floating point values, and color is an instance of the Color class.
Any other use is undefined behavior.
